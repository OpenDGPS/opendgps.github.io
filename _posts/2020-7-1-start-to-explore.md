What if exploring data in R is just one line of code?

```R
data %>% explore()
```

R would be so much more attractive to people that are doing data analytics with a GUI!

I really apprechiate the power of coding, but for fresh new R user starting to code is not easy. If you start RStudio there is not much you can do by just "playing around".
